abstract: "The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study is a longitudinal study of social values and attitudes of New Zealanders that has started in 2009 and collected data from thousands of subjects so far. Within the realm of this study, negative attitudes towards minority groups, such as discrimination and prejudice have been examined. Given that the Muslim community has recently been subjected to a terrorist attack in Christchurch, we decided to use data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study to look into Islamophobia from the Muslims' perspective, as well as the remarkable resilience of Muslims despite many challenges. In addition, we deemed necessary to investigate the overall wellbeing and flourishing of Muslims, and whether values, identity, religiosity, and meaning-making affect how Muslims perceive themselves. However, we were limited by the sample size of Muslims within the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study to make such inferences. Therefore, the current project was designed to boost the sample of Muslims within the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study in a three year quantitative longitudinal study. This protocol describes our pilot community consultation, the decisions made and modified based on consultation, community engagment, data collection, team, measures, timeline, and proposed analyses during the first year of the booster. We also address the overall nuances in terms of perceived enablers and challengers of data collection from a culturally distinct minority religious community. We think that this protocol will be useful to researchers who want to work with Muslims and similar communities in New Zealand and globally."

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

The devastating far-right extremist attack on two mosques in Christchurch that killed 51 and injured another 49 Muslims [@royalco2020], albeit shocking to the world [@worldle2019] and unprecedented in New Zealand [@jacinda2019b], was not as surprising to the Muslim community and their leadreship [@rahman2019] due to the widespread experience of Islamophobia and prejudice [@sibley2020]. With oversease reports showing increased Islamophobia following these attacks [@islamoph2022], we have reasons to see an array of hope in New Zealand due to reports of recent improved attitudes towards Muslims [@shanaah2021; @bulbulia2023]. Most New Zealand research in this area so far has shed light on such attitudes from a non-Muslim perspective. In other words, we reported on on how Muslims are perceived, and not how Muslims perceive themselves. While such reports are an absolute necessity, one can never underestimate the self-experience of Muslims themselves - the direct victims of this heinous crime.

1.  Far right terrorism and attitudes toward Muslims (Usman)
2.  Other research on Muslim wellbeing (Dr Fatima)
3.  Other ongoing projects: Qual (Farah); and Islamophobia scale to verify our previous findings (Jamila).

The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is a large longitudinal national probability annual panel study of social attitudes, personality, ideology and health outcomes that began in 2009 and has collected data from more than 70,000 subjects so far. NZAVS has been instrumental in exploring minority issues, including but not limited to discrimination, intergroup relations, identity, security, and etc. In this pursuit, NZAVS has also explored perception of Muslims and the mechanisms of attitudinal changes towards Muslims following 15 March 2019 Christchurch terrorist attacks. However, much of the NZAVS work to date with the Muslim community has focused on conveying information about how Muslims are perceived. After receiving strong positive signals from the Muslim community to scientifically explore diversity, discrimination, self-perception, resilience, meaning-making, and flourishing; this longitudinal study was conceived to address such a worthwhile scientific need. This protocol addresses our pilot community consultation, the decisions made and modified based on consultation, community engagement, data collection, team, and measures. The study primarily aims to explore the diveristy of Muslims in New Zealand, assess Muslims' perceived discrimination in comparison with other groups, unearth predictors of flourishing and meaning-making, and measure the effect of service-attendance and religious-identification on these constructs.

Introduce the context of the study, emphasizing the need to understand the psychological impact of mass trauma events on diverse populations such as the Christchurch Muslim community. Highlight the significance of longitudinal research in assessing long-term mental health outcomes.

# Background

-   Provide a brief overview of the Christchurch mosque attacks and their aftermath.
-   Discuss existing literature on the psychological effects of mass trauma events, particularly on diverse cultural groups.
-   Outline the gaps in current knowledge regarding the long-term psychological effects of such events on the Muslim community.

# Research Aims

-   Clearly state the research questions and objectives of the longitudinal study.
-   Emphasize the importance of assessing psychological outcomes over time to understand the trajectory of mental health in the affected population.

## Hypotheses

Given that the present project functions as a booster for NZAVS and uses the same questionnaires, the questions that can be answered by MDS can be limitless, and one coud suggest a large number of hypotheses to be tested and questions that can be answered from these data in the years to come. However, immediately we are trying to test the following hypotheses -- within the span of MDS:

*Hypothesis 1:* Muslims with the strongest ties to their community as measured by service attendance and prayer are buffered most from anti-Muslim prejudice.

*Hypothesis 2:* Muslims experience greater challenges to employment and health than matched members of other religious groups.

*Hypothesis 3:* Subjective well-being, the meaning of life, and psychological distress are similar among Muslims and matched members of religious groups from the buffering of religious community-making.

Having sensed interest in these data from researchers in New Zealand and overseas, it maybe possible to immediately test other hypotheses within the realm of MDS, that would be published as independent research articles.

# Method

-   **Study Design:** Describe the longitudinal design of the study, including the planned follow-up periods.

-   **Participant Selection:** Define the inclusion criteria for participants, specifying age, residency, and other relevant factors.

**Materials**

NZAVS questionnaire has a large number of measures. Here, we are only highlighting and explaining those that are pertinent to the readily planned papers that are going to published from the booster study, with levels of measurement indicated, as well as the reversed coded ones. We might choose to report further measures too, which will then be elaborated upon in the individual articles.

    5.  I feel that I am often discriminated against because of my gender. (Very Innacurate 1-7 Very Accurate)

-   Intergroup Warmth Ratings: Participants are asked to rate their feelings of warmth toward different groups using “feeling thermometer scale” for each group from least to most warmth on a 1-7 Likert scale (see @fig-warmth for reference). Groups include: NZ Europeans, Māori, Asians in general, Pacific Islanders, Elderly people, People with a disability, Refugees, Overweight people, Immigrants in general, Chinese, Indians, Muslims, LGBTQ+ people, People with mental illness.
