abstract: "The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study is a longitudinal study of social values and attitudes of New Zealanders that started in 2009. Since its inception, it has collected data from > 70,000 adults. In addition to examining numerous social, political, and health aspects of New Zealanders' lives, this research has particularly examined negative attitudes towards minority groups, such as discrimination and prejudice have been examined. In 2019, the Muslim community was the target of the worst terrorist attack in New Zealand’s modern history. Following this devastating event, we aimed to extract data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study to understand Islamophobia and its implications for the Muslim community. In addition, we deem necessary to investigate the overall wellbeing and flourishing of Muslims in New Zealand, and whether values, identity, religiosity, and meaning-making affect Muslims’ self-perception and health outcomes. However, we were limited by the sample size of Muslims within the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study to make such inferences. Therefore, the current project, titled the Muslim Diversity Study, was designed to recruit more Muslim participants within the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study over a three-year quantitative longitudinal study. This protocol describes the context that motivated this research, our pilot Muslim community consultation, the decisions made and modified based on consultation (e.g., whether or not to translate the questionnaire, which groups to target, etc.), data collection methods, research team, quantitative measures, and timeline. It also provides our initial findings and observations, mainly based on the first year of the research and addresses the perceived enablers and challengers of data collection from a culturally distinct religious community in New Zealand. This protocol will serve as a reference text for researchers conducting work not only on Islam and the Muslim community in New Zealand but also on other ethnic and religious communities and minorities in the country. It will also allow researchers to apply the methods and findings to other contexts and regions across the world and provide comparative insights and analyses."

On 15 March 2019, a devastating far-right extremist attack on two mosques took place in Christchurch, killing 51 Muslims and injuring 40 [@royalco2020]. Although this attack shocked the world [@worldle2019] and was unprecedented in New Zealand [@jacinda2019b], it was not as surprising to the Muslim community [@rahman2019] due to Muslims' widespread experience of Islamophobia and prejudice in the country [@sibley2020]. Islamophobia has been reportedly increased overseas following these attacks [@islamoph2022], however, the evidence in New Zealand seems to be mixed. While news articles have reported increased hate towards Muslims [@frykberg2023], our findings are indicative of improved attitudes towards Muslims [@shanaah2021; @bulbulia2023] following attacks. Addressing this discrepancy is beyond the scope of current article, however, it is worth noting that most of our research in this area, primarily from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) [@newzeal2024] lens, has so far shed light on such attitudes from a non-Muslim perspective. In other words, we have reported on how Muslims are perceived by non-Muslim members of New Zealand society, rather than how Muslims perceive themselves. While the published NZAVS reports are an absolute necessity, the self-experience of Muslims themselves as the direct victims of this heinous crime is equally, if not more, important.

The current article elaborates on the protocol of a pioneering three-year longitudinal study titled the Muslim Diversity Study poised to achieve this very goal – examining Muslims' self-perception in New Zealand from a variety of angles, as well as, the predictors of resilience, flourishing, and wellbeing within Muslims. The study started in 2023 and is planned to conclude in 2026. The goal is to achieve as many as 650 Muslim respondents.

## Introduction

The Muslim community has been expanding in New Zealand. Based on the 2018 census, New Zealand had more than 60,000 Muslims; which has grown to \> 75,000 according to the 2023 Census [@statsnz2024]. Studies also show that the number of converts to Islam has increased after the 2019 terror attack [@arkilic2020]. The Muslim community is uniquely positioned in New Zealand: as a growing religious minority, it is a historically stigmatized group that were the direct victims of the 2019 terrorist attack [@royalco2020; @sibley2020].

Muslim Diversity Study (MDS) — officially known as *A national longitudinal study of Muslim diversity and flourishing* embraces a community-oriented approach by collaborating with the Muslim community in order to make decisions about the execution of data collection and for identifying key questions of interest for the community at large. It is important that such processes and decisions are recorded in the form of a study protocol so that our findings are shared with the broader public and future researchers in New Zealand and across the globe can benefit from our outputs.

This protocol addresses MDS' pilot community consultation, the decisions made and modified based on consultation, community engagement, data collection, team, measures, and proposed data analysis plan. To set the rationale for MDS, it is important to have a brief look at attitudes towards Muslims in New Zealand.

## The need for Muslim Diversity Study

Muslims have generally faced prejudicial attitudes in New Zealand [@yogeeswaran2019; @sibley2020; @greaves2020]. Until the Christchurch terror attack, news stories on Islam and Muslims in New Zealand media were mostly an extension of ‘the negative othering rhetoric’, and the national media tended to link Muslim converts to jihadis [@drury2016]. Unsurprisingly, such rhetoric has been found to foster anti-Muslim prejudice [@shaver2017].

In the aftermath of Christchurch shootings, the Government introduced unprecedented counter-terrorism measures such as the prohibition of the sale of all military-style semi-automatic and assault rifles and creating the Royal Commission of Inquiry into these attacks [@royalco2020]. The Royal Commission of Inquiry presented an 800-page report emphasizing New Zealand’s inclusive and welcoming identity, among other measures [@arkilic2021a]. In addition, New Zealand press embraced a more inclusive and positive narrative with respect to Islam and Muslims [@rahman2020; @kabir2024].

Although, there have been sporadic reports of increased hate crimes after the attacks [@wilson2020], the average sentiments have improved. The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS), in a series of articles, reported the positive shift in these attitudes toward Muslims post Christchurch attacks [@shanaah2021; @bulbulia2023], and the psychological response of New Zealand public to shootings [@byrne2022].

The Christchurch shootings prompted many New Zealand research groups and institutions to further study Muslims and with Muslims, that so far have been a culturally-distinct, under-researched, minority group. These studies included trauma-focused response [@sulaiman-hill2021; @sulaiman-hill2024], inclusion, Islamophobia, and wellbeing [@junaid2024], perceived discrimination among Muslim immigrant youth [@raissi2024], the political implications of government decisions [@arkilic2021a] among others. Given that, at NZAVS, we have explored perception of Muslims and the mechanisms of attitudinal changes towards Muslims following 15 March 2019 attacks [@sibley2020; @shaver2017; @bulbulia2023; @hawi2019], it was timely and necessary that we expanded our reach further.

The NZAVS is a planned 20-year-long longitudinal national probability annual panel study of social attitudes, personality, ideology and health outcomes that began in 2009 and is currently in its 15th year. It has so far collected data from more than 70,000 New Zealand residents using the electoral roll [@sibley2024]. The NZAVS has been instrumental in exploring key issues related to minorities, including but not limited to discrimination, intergroup relations, identity, distress, security, and the dynamics and mechanisms behind them.

The NZAVS has been uniquely positioned due to its prestigious reputation (\> 150 peer-reviewed publications), longiutinal panel design, large sample size, and a large multi-disciplinary research team [@sibley2024]. More importantly, NZAVS has a nationally representative sample with data from different identity and religious group [@sibley2024], thereby, allowing us to compare data from different identity groups. However, the Muslim sample in NZAVS has been \< 100, that did not allow us to make meaningful inferences regarding Mulsim lives and issues in comparison with other religious groups. Hence, there was an immediate need to collect more data from Muslims in New Zealand.

In addition, much of the NZAVS work to date with the Muslim community has focused on conveying information about how Muslims are perceived by the non-Muslim members of New Zealand society. After receiving strong positive signals from the Muslim community to scientifically explore diversity, discrimination, self-perception, resilience, meaning-making, and flourishing; this three-year longitudinal study was conceived in 2022 to address this scholarly and community knowledge gap. Therefore, MDS is effectively a booster to NZAVS, and uses the NZAVS questionnaires to collect data from the members of Muslim community in New Zealand.

We aim to explore the diversity of Muslims in New Zealand, assess Muslims' perceived discrimination in comparison with other religious groups, unearth predictors of flourishing and meaning-making, and measure the effect of service-attendance and religious-identification on these constructs.

MDS started with pilot community consultation as detailed below in this protocol.

## Pilot community consultation

Before applying for the research grant, we deemed necessary to gauge Muslim community's interest in the project, as well as the feasibility of the project for the Muslim community. This pilot consultation took place between February and November, 2022 where the principal investigator reached out to 29 Muslims (20 representing community, religious or cultural organisations and 9 individuals) in different cities from different academic and cultural backgrounds, age groups, and genders including community leaders, religious scholars, and activists. The conversations focused around four objectives: 1) To assess the feasibility of the project for Muslims, 2) To assess interest of Muslims in the project, 3) To get feedback on the survey items, and 4) To inquire if translation may be needed. First, all 29 respondents believed that the study was feasible and timely for Muslims, and that Muslims will be interested to participate. In addition, the highest participation should be anticipated from youth, second generation migrants, educated, and women. Second, not only did they believe that the study and our planned measures were important, they have also promised to support us in every possible way.

Challenges identified: 1) The participation from Christchurch might not be up to the expectations as after Christchurch shooting people were surveyed a lot and not provided with the findings. 2) It might not be easy for people to understand the questionnaires due to unfamiliarity of the community with research. 3) The participation from elderly community and Muslim converts might be low, so we need to find avenues to address them. 4) Community members might be suspicious and consider the study to have ulterior or personal motives.

Recommendations: 1) The participants must be informed about the study motivation and be transparent and clearly communicate, benefits to the community, and that it will increase Muslims' visibility and raise their voice in research. Especially the long-term benefits for the community and their children should be made clear. 2) We should reach out to the community via trusted community, ethnic, religious organisations, and mosques. 3) For youth engagement, we should go via youth organisations such as Muslim Student Associations (MSAs) at universities. It was suggested that a family focused strategy should be used as starting with men would be more effective. 4) Findings should be shared back with the community in future due to the diversity it will present. 5) Many said that the questionnaire needs to be translated into seven ethnic languages. However, they also indicated that a majority of potential participants could comprehend the English version easily. 6) To be able to share with the community and keep them up-to-date, it was also recommended to have a unique identity and website. Therefore, instead of calling it a booster to NZAVS, the project was named Muslim Diversity Study.

This whole process led to develop a comprehensive guideline that addresses feasibility, advice on engagement with the community, the possible challenges, and avenues to enhance participation. The participants of this consultation form the Advisory Group of MDS and are being consulted regulary as needed.

## Translation

Our consultation with the community indicated that the translation may only be needed for a small number of New Zealand Muslims, and that a majority will be able to use the English version. As a result of consultation with a group (Sulaiman-Hill and colleagues) who have been conducting research within the Muslim community, instead of using the common translation back-translation procedure, we were thinking of using a more effective way of translating, back-translating, and comparing notes to ensure conceptual equivalence [@sulaiman-hill2021]. This method was inspired by the recent developments and recommendations based on the needs in countries that home an increasing number of refugees [@ozolins2020; @barger2010]. Following this, the translation was planned to be checked by experts as recommend by @fenn2020 and piloted within the Advisory Group to ensure reliability and conceptual equivalence.

However, one important aspect of MDS is comparing Muslim scores on NZAVS with members from other religious groups. With a translated questionnaire, we still faced the risk of inability to capture the attitudes and behaviours as accurately as the English version. Therefore, we would not know if differences between the scores of Muslims and other groups would be due to religious affiliation or a biased translation. We raised this problem with the Advisory Group, and it was recommended not to translate the questionnaire and to furnish the English version to all potential Muslim participants. This gave us a methodological safety-net since we could be more confident that the meaning of concepts is not distorted because of translation.

## Consultation on survey items

```{r}
# Define the votes for each item
items <- data.frame(
  item = 1:6,
  against = c(4, 4, 1, 2, 6, 1),
  in_favour = c(14, 15, 15, 14, 12, 9),
  na_undecided = c(1, 0, 3, 3, 1, 7)  # combined N/A and undecided
)

# Calculate the total number of valid votes (excluding N/A and undecided)
items$total_valid_votes <- items$against + items$in_favour

# Calculate the acceptance rate for each item as a percentage
items$acceptance_rate_percent <- as.integer((items$in_favour / items$total_valid_votes) * 100)

# Calculate the overall average acceptance rate as a percentage
overall_acceptance_percent <- as.integer(mean(items$acceptance_rate_percent))
```

In consultation with 21 members of the Advisory Group, we identified six items of the NZAVS questionnaire that could be onf a sensitive nature and may pose challenges for individuals unfamiliar with research. A clear majority (`{r} overall_acceptance_percent`% -- averaging the acceptance rate for all 6 items) thought that no items needed to be removed. Given that the that the NZAVS items were developed with considering Christianity as the largest religious group at the conception of study, we decided not to change the items for MDS to allow us comparison between scores of different religious groups. In addition, the MDS cover letter states: "As the survey is designed for the general New Zealand population, there may be questions that do not necessarily apply to you. Please feel free to skip any questions that you do not wish to answer".

## Hypotheses

*Hypothesis 1:* Muslims with the strongest ties to their community as measured by service attendance and prayer are buffered most from anti-Muslim prejudice.

*Hypothesis 2:* Muslims experience greater challenges to employment and health than matched members of other religious groups.

*Hypothesis 3:* Subjective well-being, the meaning of life, and psychological distress are similar among Muslims and matched members of religious groups from the buffering of religious community-making.

# Method

## Participants

NZAVS participants details will be available online after the completion of Wave 15 <https://osf.io/75snb/>. MDS attempts to increase the sample size of Muslims in NZAVS by *n* = 650 (\> 1% of New Zealand Muslim population), corresponding with the NZAVS sampling rate from the overall New Zealand population. Based on the 2018 Census, New Zealand had 60,261 Muslims in 2022 [@statsnz2024] --- about 1.3% of New Zealand population. As shown in @tbl-muslim-population, we selected six cities (Auckland, Christchurch, Hamilton, Wellington, Palmerston North, and Dunedin) that had at least 1,000 Muslims, for data collection. Inclusion criteria consist of self identification as Muslim, being 18 year of age or older, and currently residing in New Zealand. In sum a total of xxx Muslim participants completed the questionnaire and joined the NZAVS.

## Materials

NZAVS questionnaire consists of many psychological measures [see @sibley2024]. In this protocol, we are highlighting measures that are pertinent to the readily planned papers aimed to publish from MDS.

For Likert type scales, the minimum and maximum levels are noted along with description, for instance, 1 = Not Important, 7 = Very Important would mean that a score ranges between 1 and 7, with 1 being the minimum and 7 being the maximum score; whereas (R) indicates the reverse-scored items. Notwithstanding, we might choose to explore further measures which will then be elaborated on in the individual articles.

### Matching with other religious groups

Similar to @bulbulia2023, we will use the following variables to identify matching members in different religions groups.
1.  Age: "What is your age?" (String entry), and "When is your date of birth?" (String entry).
2.  Education: Measured by an 11-point ordinal scale (0 = No Qualification, 11 = Doctoral Degree, based on the New Zealand Qualification Framework [@thenew2016]) from responses to the qualification-related question.
3.  Employment: A binary variable is created (0 = Unemployed, 1 = Employed) based on the responses to employment item "Are you currently employed?".
4.  Ethnicity: The items displayed in @fig-ethnicgroups are categorised following the New Zealand Census Groups: European, Māori, Pacific Peoples, Asian, MELAA (Middle Eastern, Latin American/African), and Other.
5.  Gender: Responses to the string entry item "What is your gender?" will be used to create a binary variable (Male = 1, Not male = 0).
6.  Area-unit deprivation: Measured based on 2018 New Zealand Deprivation Index [@atkinson2019] that assigns a decile-rank index (1 = Least Deprived, 10 = Most Deprived) using participants' immediate neighbourhood's aggregate census information. This index is calculated using component factor analysis of nine variables in weighted order as follows: proportion of adults who received a means-tested benefit, household income, proportion not owning own home, proportion of single-parent families, the proportion of unemployed, proportion lacking qualifications, proportion household crowding, proportion no telephone access, and proportion no car access. Hence, this index reflects nationwide mean deprivation level for small neighbourhood-type units (i.e., small community areas consisting about 80-90 people).
7.  Socioeconomic status (Occupational prestige): A census-derived occupation-based measure NZSEI (New Zealand Socioeconomic Index) is used to estimate one's socioeconomic status. It uses an open-ended question regarding one's occupation, which is subsequently classified in accordance with the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO) Level 3. In the case of missing values, the measures is imputed using a combination of age and education. The measure is assigned scores between 10 = Low and High = 90.
8.  Parent: Measured by assigning a binary variable (1 = Those with children, 0 = The rest) to the item: "How many children have you given birth to, fathered, or adopted?". (String entry).
9.  Partner: Responses to "What is you relationship status?" are assigned a binary variable (1 = Has a partner, 0 = Doesn't have a partner).
10. Religious identification: Responses to "Do you identify with a religion and/or spiritual group?" are coded a binary variable (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
11. Political orientation: Responses to "Please rate how politically left-wing versus right-wing you see yourself as being" are assigned a 7-point scale (1 = Extremely left-wing, 7 = Extremely right-wing).
12. Residence: Urban or rural residence (a two-item nominal variable) is identified based on the physical addresses provided.
13. Region of habituation: Whether participants are living in an urban or rural area, based on the addresses provided, is coded; 1 = Urban, 0 = Rural.
14. Race-based rejection anxiety: "People from other races would be likely to reject me on the basis of my race". (1 = Strogly Disagree, 7 = Strongly Agree).
15. Big Six personality traits: Six personality traits, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness, honesty-humility, and neuroticism, are measured using a 7-point (1 = Very Inaccurate, 7 = Very Accurate) Mini-IPIP6 scale [@sibley2011].

## Ethics

The NZAVS was approved by the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee on 26 May 2021 until 26 May 2027 (Reference: UAHPEC22576). All participants granted informed written consent and the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee approved all procedures.

## Design

MDS is a three-year-long booster for NZAVS. NZAVS is a planned 20-year-long longitudinal panel study of adult New Zealanders, currently in its 15th year (Wave 15) that correponds with Wave 1 (the firs year) of MDS (15 Oct 2023 to 14 Oct 2024). Wave 2 and Wave 3 of MDS will correspond with NZAVS Wave 16 (15 Oct 2024 to 14 Oct 2025) and Wave 17 (15 Oct 2025 to 14 Oct 2026), respectively. NZAVS uses quantitative measures. The following dependent variables will be considered to test the proposed MDS hypotheses.

1.  Perceived religious discrimination
2.  Perceived ethnic discrimination
3.  Employment status
4.  Job satisfaction
5.  Job security
6.  Feeling valued by organisation
7.  Self-rated health
8.  Perceived health decline
9.  Chronic diseases and disabilities
10. Kessler-6 psychological distress scale
11. Meaning of life
12. Life satisfaction
13. Sense of belonging
14. Perceived support
15. Warmth toward various groups
16. Vengeful rumination
17. Forgiveness

## Data Analysis

### Hypothesis 1

-   Correlation between religiosity and prejudice
-   Regression: Service attendance, prayer frequency, religious importance, and spiritual identification (IVs) and perceived discrimination (DV)
-   Moderation: Testing whether or not community involvement moderates the relationship between religiosity and perceived discrimination.
-   Mediation: Whether or not the sense of belonging mediates relationship between religiosity and perceived discrimination.

### Hypothesis 2

-   Using propensity score matching to match Muslims with participants from other religious groups based on variables used in previous publications, such as @bulbulia2023. These are: age, education, employment, ethnicity, gender, deprivation index, socioeconomic status, being a parent, having a partner, religious identification, political orientation, urban vs. rural residence, region, race-based anxiety, and Big Six personality measures.
-   Regression: Employment status (binary) predicted from religious affiliation, job satisfaction, and job security.
-   Regression: Self-rated health and disability predicted from religious affiliation, health behaviours, and chronic diseases.
-   Chi square: Religious affiliation vs employment status and disability status.

### Hypothesis 3

-   Matching participants similar to Hypothesis 2.
-   ANOVA: Comparing average scores of subjective wellbeing as well as psychological distress between Muslims and members of other religions.
-   Regression: Community support and religious community-making buffering against distress and enhancing wellbeing
-   Structural equation modelling: Modelling mediation of community-making on the relationship between religious affiliation and wellbeing outcomes.
-   Moderation: To find out whether the strength of community support and belonging moderate the effects of religious group membership on wellbeing and distress.

## Preregistration

The hypotheses, measures, and proposed data analysis are preregistered on OSF (<https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/B39XT>). The study was preregistered before any attempted data analyses.

## Procedure

### Research assistant recruitment and training

The 30 research assistants, as indicated in @tbl-muslim-population, were recruited before the MDS Wave 1. The position was advertised by University of Canterbury and shared via social media, emails, and community organisations. The eligibility criteria included the least of tertiary level education in New Zealand, familiarity with research in humanities, interest in working with community, and experiences of working with a Muslim community organisation. Thirty research assistants were recruited after initial screening and interviews from a total of 95 applicants.

Before the commencement of study, a series of comprehensive Zoom trainings took place to familiarise research assistants with NZAVS, the MDS background, and survey questionnaires. In addition, research assistants learned about ethnical guidelines, confidentiality principles, and interacting with a culturally diverse participants pool.

### Data collection

```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  City = c("Auckland", "Palmerston North", "Christchurch", "Wellington", "Dunedin", "Hamilton"),
  Total_Organizations = c(138, 5, 21, 20, 18, 16),
  Reached_Out = c(52, 4, 17, 17, 6, 9),
  Responded = c(43, 4, 11, 10, 6, 6)
)

# Display the data
#print("City-wise data:")
#print(data)

# Calculate the total for each category
total_organizations <- sum(data$Total_Organizations)
total_reached_out <- sum(data$Reached_Out)
total_responded <- sum(data$Responded)

# Display the totals
#cat("Total number of organizations: ", total_organizations, "\n")
#cat("Total number of organizations reached out to: ", total_reached_out, "\n")
#cat("Total number of responses: ", total_responded, "\n")
```

Research assistants used the snowball approach for data collection. They started reaching out to their close circles, and kept expanding their reach. The sample was non-representative, and participants had the choice of filling in the online questionnaire using Qualtrics, or a paper questionnaire and returning it to the NZAVS headquarters in Auckland University using a pre-paid postal envelope.

After the initial stage of reaching out to the close circle, the research assistants started reaching out to community organisations. A runsheet was provided, and different documents and promotional materials such as individual messages, community messages, flyers, and posters were at the research assistants disposal based on their needs. We have also developed a clear vision statement and ethics statement that were part of our MDS introductory letter. In addition, an additinal cover letter was sent to all Muslim participants alongside the information sheet. It was aimed to clearly convey the purposes of booster to the community. Please see appendices A-H for these materials. Finally, 10 promotional shirts were designed that the research assistants wore during festivals and community events for study promotion.

The social media campaign started at the beginning of 2024 and continued until the end of Wave 1. Beside regular posts on a weekly, and later on, on a fortnighly basis; we also used paid promotion to increase reach of the project.

For the purposes of community promotion, we relied on a combination of community outreach at local mosques, religious, community, and ethnic organisations, Muslim schools and businesses, and MSA’s (Muslim Student Associations). From available databases and community contacts, we identified `{r} total_organizations` organisations and RAs were able to approach Muslims in `{r} total_reached_out` organisations. Out of these, `{r} total_responded` have endorsed and promoted the study. Different organisations endorsed us in different manners: some allowed us to give speeches to their audience, others shared our promotional material online in social media, community message groups (e.g., WhatsApp), and mailing lists. In addition, tens of posters were placed in community facilities (e.g., mosques) and hundreds of flyers were handed over after Friday prayers as well as cultural and religious festivals.

In addition to reaching out to organisations, the principal investigator conversed with 28 local and national community leaders, celebrities, religious scholars, and academics to spread our message to the communities. As part of this recruitment drive, the principal investigator also presented 28 talks, presentations, or lectures to Muslim community groups around New Zealand via mosques, universities, or community organisations in the mentioned cities, explaining the goals of the NZAVS, and how it would benefit the New Zealand Muslim community to be represented in this ongoing national longitudinal panel sample. Five additional talks were delivered by research assistants too.

### Ensuring research assistants' convenience

MDS research assistants come from differnet backgrounds. Some of them have had extensive researcch experience, whereas, for the some of them, it was the first attempt of engaging in data collection. Some research assistants wanted explicit weekly targets and others decided their own targets. The principal investigator conducted fortnightly check-ins with individuals and teams in cities to ensure that questions are answered, and was always available to guide the process, provide feedback. The principal investigator was also available talk with participants if and when needed via audio and video mediums.

### Web hosting

The MDS website (access from [here](https://linktr.ee/muslimdiversity)) provides the most up-to-date and needed information for public and professionals and will keep updating as we make progress.

### Data management
The collected data are processed in the NZAVS headquarters, deidentified, and only made available to trusted researchers and collaborators. The NZAVS data dictionary, sampling procedure, sample details and other relevant information can be accessed online (<https://osf.io/75snb/wiki/home/>) [@sibley2024].

## Timeline

As displayed in @fig-ethnicgroups2, the community consultation started before Wave 1 and continued until the end of it. In addition, social media marketing has been an integral part of MDS data collection campaign. The planned future events, with approximate dates, are indicated too.

Present a timeline indicating key milestones in the study, including recruitment periods, data collection waves, and analysis phases.

## Enablers and challengers of data collection

Based on our interactions with the Muslim community and feedback from research assistants, we anecdotally know that the following elements encourage increased participantion of the Muslim community in research.

1.  Building rapport
2.  Addressing concerns regarding confidentiality and data management
3.  Being transparent and truthful with the community
4.  Approaching the community via trusted leaders
5.  Reaching out to inviduals personally, not via groups.

We also learned that the following factors could hinder data collection efforts.

1.  Length of the questionnaire measured by the time taken to complete it
2.  Unfamiliarity of participants with scientific research
3.  Privacy concerns
4.  Political climate
5.  Language barriers
6.  Generatioanl differences, with older generations less likely to take part.

Although these findings are anecdotal, we have witnessed enhanced participation by addressing some of the challengers to data collection. To better understand and document, we have conducted a qualitative research of research assistant experiences in terms of data collection [@afzali2024]. Findings from this research will be published in the near future.

## Strengths and limitations

Quantitative only. focus on english speakers only 1. Zahra E, Rizwan, Somia

Generalisablity

## Application and implications

Aamina Ali, Adepate Mustapha-Koiki

Potential contributions of the study to the field of mental health research and implications for policy and practice.

## Conclusion

MDS is a crucial booster for the NZAVS because not only it addresses the under-representation of Muslim in NZVAS, but it only helps us answer many questions about Muslims' self-perception, meaning-making, flourishing, religiosity, and health outcomes. The current protocol also provides a preliminary understanding of how to work with a minoritised religious community in a culturally sensitive manner. Further discoveries are going to be published by the MDS team in the near future. Despite the well-known limitations of observational, quantitative, survey research, MDS provides substantial values in terms of implications and applications. Techniques learned from MDS can be applied while working with Muslims and other culturally similar groups in New Zealand and overseas.
