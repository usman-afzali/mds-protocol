abstract: "The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study is a longitudinal study of social values and attitudes of New Zealanders that has started in 2009 and collected data from thousands of subjects so far. Within the realm of this study, negative attitudes towards minority groups, such as discrimination and prejudice have been examined. Given that the Muslim community has recently been subjected to a terrorist attack in Christchurch, we decided to use data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study to look into Islamophobia from the Muslims' perspective, as well as the remarkable resilience of Muslims despite many challenges. In addition, we deemed necessary to investigate the overall wellbeing and flourishing of Muslims, and whether values, identity, religiosity, and meaning-making affect how Muslims perceive themselves. However, we were limited by the sample size of Muslims within the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study to make such inferences. Therefore, the current project was designed to boost the sample of Muslims within the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study over a three year quantitative longitudinal study. This protocol describes our pilot community consultation, the decisions made and modified based on consultation, community engagment, data collection, team, measures, timeline, and proposed analyses, mostly focusing on the first year of the booster. We also address the overall nuances in terms of perceived enablers and challengers of data collection from a culturally distinct minority religious community. We think that this protocol will be useful to researchers who want to work with Muslims and similar communities in New Zealand and globally."

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

The devastating far-right extremist attack on two mosques in Christchurch that killed 51 and injured another 49 Muslims [@royalco2020], albeit shocking to the world [@worldle2019] and unprecedented in New Zealand [@jacinda2019b], was not as surprising to the Muslim community and their leadreship [@rahman2019] due to the widespread experience of Islamophobia and prejudice [@sibley2020]. With oversease reports showing increased Islamophobia following these attacks [@islamoph2022], we have reasons to see an array of hope in New Zealand due to reports of recent improved attitudes towards Muslims [@shanaah2021; @bulbulia2023]. Most of our research in this area, primarily from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) [@newzeal2024] lens, has so far shed light on such attitudes from a non-Muslim perspective. In other words, we have reported on how Muslims are perceived, and not how Muslims perceive themselves. While the published NZAVS reports are an absolute necessity, one can never underestimate the self-experience of Muslims themselves - the direct victims of this heinous crime. This article aims to elaborate on the protocol of a pioneering longitudinal study that is poised to achieve the very goal – examining Muslims' self-perception in New Zealand from a variety of angles, as well as, the predictors of resilience, flourishing, and wellbeing within Muslims. Given that the Muslim community is positioned very uniquely in New Zealand: a minority, historically stigmatized group that were direct victims of a terrorist attacks and showed remarkable resilience [@royalco2020; @sibley2020; @anwar2020], we had to consult with the community, make and/or amend decisions based on the feedback received, and learn from other stakeholders that had worked with community. Therefore, it is important that such processes and decisions are recorded in the form of a study protocol so that the future researchers in New Zealand and across the globe can benefit and save valuable research time and resources.

## Perception of Muslims based on NZAVS

The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is a large longitudinal national probability annual panel study of social attitudes, personality, ideology and health outcomes that began in 2009 and has so far collected data from more than 70,000 subjects [@newzeal2024]. NZAVS has been instrumental in exploring minority issues, including but not limited to discrimination, intergroup relations, identity, distress, security, etc, and the dynamics and mechanisms behind them. For instance, our findings indicated the importance of national identity in Muslim perception [@yogeeswaran2019]. More specifically, the more one believed a specific ancestral heritage (being European or Māori) or cultural aspects (ability to speak English) were important for being considered a *true* New Zealander, the lower they rated their level of warmth toward Muslims [@yogeeswaran2019]. A follow-up longitudinal examination indicated that the warmth rating of Muslims has historically been the lowest (based on data from 2012-2018) compared to other minority groups (Indians, Chinese, immigrants in general, and Asians in general), though, there was a small steady increase in warmth towards all groups along these years [@sibley2020]. @sibley2020 also indicated that lower education, lower socioeconomic status, being male, older age, unemployment, lower agreeableness (based on Big-6 personality test), and lower on openness (based on Big-6 personality test) predicted lower warmth toward Muslims. Interestingly, but not unexpectedly, warmth rating of Mulsims was increased unprecedentedly (above and beyond the steady small increase reported in @sibley2020) following Christchurch shootings [@shanaah2021], and sustained for three years post shootings [@bulbulia2023]. @bulbulia2023 indicated that shootings caused increase in warmth toward Muslims, but not toward other groups – known as negative controls – stigmatised groups that were not anticipated to be affected by the shootings (e.g., people with mental illness, overweight people, and elderly people).

**Warmth vs islamophobia (Jamila).**

psychological effects.

This implied that has also explored perception of Muslims and the mechanisms of attitudinal changes towards Muslims following 15 March 2019 Christchurch terrorist attacks [@hawi2019; @yogeeswaran2019; @byrne2022; @sibley2020]. However, much of the NZAVS work to date with the Muslim community has focused on conveying information about how Muslims are perceived. After receiving strong positive signals from the Muslim community to scientifically explore diversity, discrimination, self-perception, resilience, meaning-making, and flourishing; this longitudinal study was conceived to address such a worthwhile scientific need. This protocol addresses our pilot community consultation, the decisions made and modified based on consultation, community engagement, data collection, team, and measures. The study primarily aims to explore the diveristy of Muslims in New Zealand, assess Muslims' perceived discrimination in comparison with other groups, unearth predictors of flourishing and meaning-making, and measure the effect of service-attendance and religious-identification on these constructs.

Introduce the context of the study, emphasizing the need to understand the psychological impact of mass trauma events on diverse populations such as the Christchurch Muslim community. Highlight the significance of longitudinal research in assessing long-term mental health outcomes.

1.  Far right terrorism and attitudes toward Muslims (Usman)
2.  Other research on Muslim wellbeing (Dr Fatima)
3.  Other ongoing projects: Qual (Farah); and Islamophobia scale to verify our previous findings (Jamila).

# Background

-   Provide a brief overview of the Christchurch mosque attacks and their aftermath.
-   Discuss existing literature on the psychological effects of mass trauma events, particularly on diverse cultural groups.
-   Outline the gaps in current knowledge regarding the long-term psychological effects of such events on the Muslim community.

# Research Aims

-   Clearly state the research questions and objectives of the longitudinal study.
-   Emphasize the importance of assessing psychological outcomes over time to understand the trajectory of mental health in the affected population.

## Hypotheses

Given that the present project functions as a booster for NZAVS and uses the same questionnaires, the questions that can be answered by MDS can be limitless, and one coud suggest a large number of hypotheses to be tested and questions that can be answered from these data in the years to come. However, immediately we are trying to test the following hypotheses -- within the span of MDS:

*Hypothesis 1:* Muslims with the strongest ties to their community as measured by service attendance and prayer are buffered most from anti-Muslim prejudice.

*Hypothesis 2:* Muslims experience greater challenges to employment and health than matched members of other religious groups.

*Hypothesis 3:* Subjective well-being, the meaning of life, and psychological distress are similar among Muslims and matched members of religious groups from the buffering of religious community-making.

Having sensed interest in these data from researchers in New Zealand and overseas, it maybe possible to immediately test other hypotheses within the realm of MDS, that would be published as independent research articles.

# Method

-   **Study Design:** Describe the longitudinal design of the study, including the planned follow-up periods.

-   **Participant Selection:** Define the inclusion criteria for participants, specifying age, residency, and other relevant factors.

    Mulsim = 1.3% of New Zealand population.

**Materials**

NZAVS questionnaire has a large number of measures. Here, we are only highlighting and explaining those that are pertinent to the readily planned papers that are going to published from the booster study, with levels of measurement indicated, as well as the reversed coded ones. For Likert type scales, we are noting the the minimum and maximum level along with description. For instance, *(Not important 1-7 Very important)* would mean that it is rated on a scale of 1 to 7 where 1 indicates not important and 7 indicates very important. Notwithstanding, we might choose to report further measures too, which will then be elaborated upon in the individual articles.

-   Matching with other religious group: Similar to @bulbulia2023, we will use the following demography and personality variables to identify matching members in different religions groups.

    1.  Age: What is your age? (String entry) and when is your date of birth (String entry)

    2.  Education: An 11-point ordinal scale (No qualification 0-11 Doctoral degree, based on the New Zealand Qualification Framework [@thenew2016]) based on the responses to the qualification-related question.

    3.  Employment: A binary variable is created (0 = unemployed, 1 = employed) based on the responses to employment items "Are you currently employed?"

    4.  Ethnicity: The items displayed in @fig-ethnicgroups are categorised following the New Zealand Census Groups: European, Māori, Pacific Peoples, Asian, MELAA (Middle Eastern, Latin American/African), and Other.

    5.  Gender: Responses to the string entry item "What is your gender?", gender will be used to create a binary measure (Male = 1, Not male = 0).

    6.  Socioeconomic status: Measured based on 2013 New Zealand Deprivation Index [@atkinson2014] that assigns a decile-rank index (Least deprived 1-10 Most deprived) using participants' immediate neighbourhood's aggregate census information. This index is calculated using component factor analysis of nine variables in weighted order as follows: proportion of adults who received a means-tested benefit, household income, proportion not owning own home, proportion of single-parent families, the proportion of unemployed, proportion lacking qualifications, proportion household crowding, proportion no telephone access, and proportion no car access. Hence, this index reflects nationwide mean deprivation level for small neighbourhood-type units (i.e., small community areas consisting about 80-90 people).

    7.  Parent: Measured by assigning a binary variable (1 = those with children, 0 = the rest) to the item: How many children have you given birth to, fathered, or adopted? (String entry).

    8.  Partner: Responses to "What is you relationship status?" are assigned a binary variable (1 = Has a partner, 0 = Doesn't have a partner).

    9.  Religious identification: "Yes" responses to "Do you identify with a religion and/or spiritual group?" are assigned 1 and "No" responses are coded 0.

    10. Political orientation: Based on responses to "Please rate how politically left-wing versus right-wing you see yourself as being", political orientation is assigned a 7-point scale (extremely left-wing 1-7 extremely right-wing).

    11. Residence: Urban or rural residence (a two-item nominal variable) is identified based on the physical addresses provided.

    12. Region of habituation (?)

    13. Occupational prestige (?)

    14. Race rejection anxiety:

    15. Big six personality traits: Six personality traits, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness, honesty-humility, and neuroticism, are measured using a 7-point (very inaccurate 1-7 very accurate) Mini-IPIP6 scale [@sibley2011].
